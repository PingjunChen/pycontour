# pycontour
Package for the operation of contours, using numpy array as the basic contour representation.

## Origin
Contour is one of the most important concept in plentiful image-based applications.
There are several packages owning contour operation utilities. OpenCV provides a few contour extraction and attribute (area, et al.) calculation functions. Shapely is mainly designed for geometric object analysis, with specific data structures. Numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. We propose this package to use Numpy array as basic contour representation. OpenCV and shapely would be used as internal operations.


## Installation
* pip install opencv-python
* pip install shapely
