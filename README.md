# pycontour
Contour operation utilities, using numpy array as fundamental representation.

## Origin
Contour is one of the most important concept in plentiful image-based applications, especially in medical imaging field, mainly for region of interest (ROI). [OpenCV](http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html) and [shapely](http://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html) both provide a few contour operation support. This package tries to simplify the usage of contour operation, with numpy as the fundamental representation for contour. Required packages can be installed through "pip install requirements.txt".
